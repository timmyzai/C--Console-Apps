The code defines three classes: Dog, Cat, and AnimalShelterManager. Dog and Cat are classes that implement the IAnimal interface, which has two properties: Name and MakeSound(). AnimalShelterManager is the main class that handles the user interface and manages the animal shelter. It has the following methods:

Main() - entry point of the application
DisplayMenu() - displays the options menu for the user
AddAnimal() - adds a new animal to the shelter
MakeAllSounds() - makes all the animals in the shelter make their corresponding sounds
DisplayAllAnimals() - displays all the animals in the shelter
RemoveAnimal() - removes an animal from the shelter
SearchAnimal() - searches for an animal in the shelter

The AnimalShelterManager class also contains two AnimalShelter instances, dogShelter and catShelter, which are generic classes that store lists of Dog and Cat objects, respectively. The AnimalShelter class has methods for adding, removing, and searching for animals, as well as displaying all the animals in the shelter.
